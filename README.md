# telloDroneAutomation
Drone code taken from the Ryze Tello github site and then modified to be more easily called with functions.  Read the code and use it to automate the flight of your Tello drone.

This code is allowed to modified for the CS4Me Day hackathon, and can be your starter code to get things to work for your drone.  Adding to, and improving, this code counts as points towards code modificaitons. You are allowed to start code improvements now, and until the end of the hackathon.
